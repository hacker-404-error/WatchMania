                            If there’s one watch brand out there that everybody knows, it’s Rolex. The very name has become a byword for luxury and exclusivity. Wearing a Rolex is more than just wearing a watch. It’s a statement of power and prestige. There’s a good reason why people still buy Rolex watches despite the Apple Watch dominance in the global industry.

                            From its classic collection to its dive and yacht-master watches, Rolex applies its decades of horological experience and technical know-how to the question of creating quality swiss timepieces that owners can carry with them all their lives—and pass on to their children.

                            Switzerland has become synonymous with luxury watches and one of the top Swiss watch brands of all time is Patek Philippe. 

                            The last family-owned independent watch manufacturer left in Geneva, the company was founded in 1839, and has remained in the hands of the Stern family since then. This continuity of ownership allows Patek Philippe to maintain its unique identity. The brand takes its creative freedom seriously. 
                            
                            Indeed, it’s Patek Philippe’s unparalleled approach to design that has allowed the swiss manufacturer to achieve status as one of the best watch companies in the world.

                            Audemars Piguet is one of the most famous high-end watch companies in the world. Created in the Vallée de Joux of the Jura Mountains in Switzerland by Jules-Louis Audemars and Edward Auguste Piguet, AP watches now travel the world on the wrists of the rich and famous, including the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jay-Z, and James LeBron. 

                            What secured AP a seat at the table among the most successful global watch brands was its Royal Oak model. Introduced in 1972, the Royal Oak was the first stainless steel sports watch to be marketed as a luxury timepiece, combining style and durability for the first time ever.

                            The first German luxury watch brand on our list, at A. Lange and Söhne, excellence and perfection is a priority at every stage of the process. The company prides itself on the dedication of all its workers and their commitment to consistently delivering the best.

                            At the heart of A. Lange and Söhne is a unique history. Founded in 1845, the company was expropriated after the Second World War. It wasn’t until after the reunification of Germany in 1990 that it would return.

                            The first brand from the Swatch Group on our list, Omega has been delivering exceptional luxury watches to horophiles and watch collectors for more than 170 years.

                            Omega watches have travelled to the North Pole, been launched into space, and descended into the depths of the ocean in submarines. As a consequence, Omega has gained a reputation as one of the successful wristwatch brands in the world.

                            Perpetual calendars, tourbillons, carousels, and chronographs—the level of intricacy of the mechanisms contained within a Blancpain watch are astounding. Creating one requires an almost unimaginable capacity for precision. 

                            It also requires time. Indeed, only 30 watches are produced in the Blancpain workshop each day. This means there are only a limited number out there, which brings Blancpain to an incredible level of exclusivity, propelling the Swatch Group brand into the very top tier of luxury watches.

                            An IWC Schaffhausen watch is that rare thing: a luxury accessory that marries flawless functionality with exceptional design.

                            Jaeger-LeCoultre is known within the industry for its inventiveness. In fact, JLC has developed over 1,200 individual calibers and holds 400 unique patents—a testament to its capacity for cutting-edge design.

                            Many luxury watches tend towards the bulkier end of the spectrum. For many people, they want something more low-key, understated, and less obtrusive on the wrist. Piaget took up the challenge.

                            Indeed, Piaget is most famous for being a pioneer in ultra-thin watch calibers. This is the company behind both the world’s thinnest manual wind watch and the world’s thinnest automatic watch. Today, Piaget is known for its slim and pared-back designs—the last word in horological elegance.
